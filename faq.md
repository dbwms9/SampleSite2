# FAQ

### Q: Who is this workshop for?

A: This workshop is for students, researchers and other scientific professionals who would like to learn more about workflows and how they can improve the communication of their science methods, enhance reproducibility, support the use of standards and open source tools and shorten their time to science.
<hr />

### Q: What are the technical requirements?

A: Some basic understanding of processes used in scientific research will help, but this training workshop will also introduce some of those concepts.
<hr />

### Q: How do I register for the workshop?

A: Please fill out [this registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PidKkpr9bPdiAazUKBHlZ27Wrou1MyFfS7Qyv-hoLXM/viewform?edit_requested=true) by **March 15, 2021**.
